# leaflet-challenge

Background

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 

 In this challenge, a method was developed to visualize USGS data to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Instructions 

This pratice is composed of two parts: 

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data

# part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

1. The GeoJSON earthquake data of all earthquakes in past 7 days was collected from the USGS website

2. The selected data was mported and visualized:

Using Leaflet, a map was creaed that plot all the earthquakes from the dataset based on the longitude and latitude.

The data markers weere created reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake by the size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 

Popups were created to provide additional information about the earthquake when the associated marker is clicked.

A legend was created to provide context for the map data.

# Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data

The second dataset on the map was plotted to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity by pulling and adding tectonic plates dataset alongside the orignal date. 

There are very features: 

1. The tectonic plates dataset was plotted on the map in addition to the earthquakes.

2. One more base map was added

3. Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

4. Added layer controls
